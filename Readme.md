# Web Scraping Using Python (BeautifulSoup)


## Introduction: What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. <br>

In this project we are going to use amazon product (ps5) search result link as the source of our raw data [link](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=playstation+5&sprefix=pla%2Caps%2C464&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_3).


## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6+
2. install BeautifulSoup **```pip install beautifulsoup4```**
3. install Requests **```pip install requests```**
4. install Pandas **```pip install pandas```**
5. the user-agent of your browser. To get the user-agent, just search for "my user agent" on Google and copy the user-agent string.
6. product search url from amazon


## Process of Web Scraping
1. Importing the required libraries
2. Specifying the URL containing the dataset and passing it to **`requests.get()`** to get the HTML content of the page.
3. Using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content
4. Extracting the required information from the data
5. Saving the pandas dataframe as a CSV file called **`Amazon Data.csv`**


## Project Specifications
1. It contains a python file **`scraper.py`** which contains the rough codes to be used in the final notebook file.
2. It contains a jupyter notebook file **`Amazon Web Scraper.ipynb`** which contains the final codes to be used in the project.
